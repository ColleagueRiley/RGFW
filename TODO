- look into using a single X11 display rather than one display per window
- update wayland support (wayland is sus)
- ablity to create an RGFW window from an existing window 
- Xrandr reporting unused monitor as the window's monitor 
- look into a function like `RGFW_isGLSoftware` to check if WGL/GLX/EGL/etc is using a software rendering driver 

(extra stuff)
- look into monitor gamma
- clipboard images
- IME support 
- webGL support (x11) (winapi) (macos ?) web (review))
