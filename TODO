- look into using a single X11 display rather than one display per window
- update wayland support (wayland is sus)
- ablity to create an RGFW window from an existing window 
- unfocusing unholds the mouse, make it so refocusing grabs the mouse again (if it's supposed to be held) (may only be a windows issue)

(extra stuff)
- look into monitor gamma
- set gamepad mappings
- set gamepad rumble
- clipboard images
- IME support 
- webGL support (x11) (winapi) (macos ?) web (review))
