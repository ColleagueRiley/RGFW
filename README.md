# About
RGFW:

* **is** an stb-style single headerfile and is very portable 
* **is** primarly written in C99 in mind
* **has** a C89 compatible API on going changes to make the implementation more C89 friendly
* **is** comparable to GLFW or aspects of SDL but it's leading motive is to be a flexible and lightweight windowing library
* **is** a very small compared to other libraries
* **is** a general framework and can be used for games, apps or tools
* **does** only depend on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa, etc **NO** dependencies
* **does** help you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGPU, Metal, or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls
* **is** customizable, you enable or disable features
* **does** work with X11 (UNIX), Wayland (*experimental*) (LINUX), Cocoa (MacOS), Emscripten (WASM) and WinAPI (tested on windows *XP*, 10, 11, reactOS and has limited 9x support)
* **is** multi-paradigm, with a flexible event system, including multiple ways of handling events (callbacks, queue, state lookups)
* **does** include a large number of examples for learning RGFW

RGFW:

* does **not** handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context)
* is **not** an OpenGL focused library, RGFW can be used with ANY graphics API
* does **not** do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality

There is a Makefile including for compiling th examples. NOTE: `WAYLAND=1` OR  can be defined to compile for wayland. `WAYLAND_X11=1` can be used instead if you want examples to fallback to X11 if a Wayland display is not found. This adds `#define RGFW_WAYLAND` in the implementation (or defines `RGFW_WAYLAND` AND `RGFW_X11`)

Included in the framework are helper functions for multiple rendering APIs OpenGL (Native, EGL, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, [Metal](https://github.com/ColleagueRiley/RGFW/blob/main/examples/metal/metal.m) and WebGPU, you can also easily blit raw data directly onto the window with the `RGFW_surface` object using `RGFW_window_blitSurface`.

You must explicitly request these helper functions via, `#define RGFW_OPENGL`, `#define RGFW_VULKAN`, `#define RGFW_DIRECTX`, `#define RGFW_WEBGPU`.

# Getting started
## a very simple example
```c
#define RGFW_IMPLEMENTATION
#define RGFW_OPENGL /* if this line is not added, OpenGL functions will not be included */
#include "RGFW.h"

#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef RGFW_MACOS
#include <OpenGL/gl.h> /* why does macOS do this */
#else
#include <GL/gl.h>
#endif

void keyfunc(RGFW_window* win, RGFW_key key, u8 keyChar, RGFW_keymod keyMod, RGFW_bool repeat, RGFW_bool pressed) {
    RGFW_UNUSED(repeat);
    if (key == RGFW_escape && pressed) {
        RGFW_window_setShouldClose(win, 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    /* the RGFW_windowOpenGL flag tells it to create an OpenGL context, but you can also create your own with RGFW_window_createContext_OpenGL */
    RGFW_window* win = RGFW_createWindow("a window", 0, 0, 800, 600, RGFW_windowCenter | RGFW_windowNoResize | RGFW_windowOpenGL);

    RGFW_setKeyCallback(keyfunc); // you can use callbacks like this if you want

    while (RGFW_window_shouldClose(win) == RGFW_FALSE) {
        RGFW_event event;
        while (RGFW_window_checkEvent(win, &event)) {  // or RGFW_pollEvents(); if you only want callbacks
            // you can either check the current event yourself
            if (event.type == RGFW_quit) break;

            if (event.type == RGFW_mouseButtonPressed && event.button.value == RGFW_mouseLeft) {
                printf("You clicked at x: %d, y: %d\n", event.mouse.x, event.mouse.y);
            }

            // or use the existing functions
            if (RGFW_isMousePressed(win, RGFW_mouseRight)) {
                printf("The right mouse button was clicked at x: %d, y: %d\n", event.mouse.x, event.mouse.y);
            }
        }

        // OpenGL 1.1 is used here for a simple example, but you can use any version you want (if you request it first (see gl33/gl33.c))
        glClearColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );

        glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
            glColor3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); glVertex2f(-0.6f, -0.75f);
            glColor3f(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); glVertex2f(0.6f, -0.75f);
            glColor3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); glVertex2f(0.0f, 0.75f);
        glEnd();

        RGFW_window_swapBuffers_OpenGL(win);
        glFlush();
    }

    RGFW_window_close(win);
    return 0;
}
