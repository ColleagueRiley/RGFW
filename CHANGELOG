Current Version: RGFW 1.5.5-dev
-----------------------------------------------
- fix wasm key event bug (key release events not being processed)
- Get rid of `RGFW_ALLOC_DROPFILES` (it's not actually useful)
- Replace `RGFW_window_setBufferPtr` and `RGFW_setBufferSize` with `RGFW_window_initBuffer`, `RGFW_window_initBufferSize` and `RGFW_window_initBufferPtr`
    Also forces the user to run `RGFW_window_initBuffer` to allocate a buffer
- Get rid of RGFW_allocator, most of the memory that needs to be allocated is optional and is allocated on init anyway.
- fix xDND data restarts bug 
- print errors in writeclipboard (X11)
- fix macOS titlebar api (borderless window)
- update Vulkan example (fix crashes with certain drivers, have triangle follow mouse)
- rewrite writeclipboard, ensure the selection is properly being handled and the clipboard is properly being saved after the window is closed
- add icon example
- review winapi window_setIcon (fixes HICON persistance issue)
- remove RGFW_mouseNone (fixes overflow bug, RGFW_mouseNone isn't used anyway)
- expose RGFW_moveToMacOSResourceDir to the public API
- add `RGFW_window_center`
- add `RGFW_window_borderless`, `RGFW_window_allowsDND` and `RGFW_window_mouseHidden` for checking for args
- add flags example
- fix `RGFW_window_setMaxSize` / `RGFW_window_setMinSize` winapi, use `SetPropA` `GetPropA` to get the window in `WndProc`
- make RGFW_window_isMaximized actually maximize the window width the API
- fix RGFW_window_setBorder not working after window creation (X11)
- change b8/b32 to single changeable bool type `RGFW_bool`, add `RGFW_BOOL` macro for forcing an int to be bool
- add `CONVENTIONS.md`
- fix window flag bugs (macOS)
- RGFW_window_maximize uses `toggleFullScreen` if the window has no border (macOS)
- skip x11 mouse button events if the mouse button > 5
- fix RGFW_window_eventWait, make sure RGFW_eventWaitNext is converted if it needs to be, ensure the correct time is used, (winapi, cocoa), make waitMS unsigned
- add support for extra mouse buttons RGFW_mouseMisc1 - RGFW_mouseMisc5

Release:    RGFW 1.5 (Jan 14, 2024)
-----------------------------------------------
This may not include all of the changes or breaking changes made.
This is because 1.5 is the first release and I started taking releases and release notes more seriously. 

In later commits, the CHANGELOG will be updated while the release is being worked on.
1.5 also has many breaking changes. These are essential changes for API consistency and to expose functionality better. Later releases will aim to have fewer breaking commits. I wanted to get as many of these changes out of the way while the project is still relatively new.

major changes:
    - gamepad rewrite
    - keycode rewrite
    - macOS gamepad support
    - RGFW_allocator, RGFW_createWindowPtr and better memory control
    - monitor refinement
    - A lot of bug fixes

breaking changes:
    - gamepad rewrite changes JS/Joystick -> gamepad
    - clipboard is now freed by RGFW
    - rewrite keymods/ledState -> modState (Control, Shift, numlock, capslock, alt)
    - RGFW_window_setMouse -> RGFW_loadMouse, RGFW_window_setMouse, RGFW_freeMouse
    - make enum naming more consistent, make window args enums
        RGFW_Key -> RGFW_key
        RGFW_Control -> RGFW_control (for example)
        
        RGFW_(ARG) -> RGFW_window(Arg) 
        RGFW_CENTER -> RGFW_windowCenter
    - RGFW_window_setMouse -> RGFW_loadMouse, RGFW_window_setMouse, RGFW_freeMouse


all changes:

new features:
- RGFW_setClassName, allows program class (grouping) to be set 
- start of MacOS EGL support
- add support for loading a icon from a .rc file
- add RGFW_allocator for runtime changes to allocator
- add RGFW_readClipboardPtr to load clipboard data into a buffer, or send a NULL buffer to get the size
- RGFW_createWindowPtr to create a window without allocating a window struct
- add gamepad support for macOS (IOKit) 
- Add XDL.h to this repo for optionally  dynamically linking X11
- autofree clipboard (no need to free it yourself)
- RGFW_window_setBufferPtr to set win->buffer to your own pointer
- RGFW_window_setMouse -> RGFW_loadMouse, RGFW_window_setMouse, RGFW_freeMouse
- Wayland fallback
    - fallback to X functions when wayland function isn't yet supported (eg. clipboard)
    - Fallback to X when wayland compositor is not found (eg. when using a X11 server)
    - Allow the user to switch to wayland/X during runtime (you have to compile with Wayand support (RGFW_WAYLAND))
bugs:
- Fix GLX runtime errors for certain GPUs 
- Fix C++ support, mostly fixes warnings and errors
- fix ctypes, drop support for non stdint ctypes (MSVC)
- fix RGFW_window_resize lock (when RGFW_noResize is enabled)
- fix xDND crash 
- fix Multi-window bugs (macOS)
- fix event misses when unknown event is sent
- fix scale/center order
- make it easier to add custom backends
- allow for less linking to be required (eg. -lopengl32 -lwimm, optional `RGFW_USE_XDL`)
reviews/rewrites
- Wayland rewrite
    - integrate wayland with X code, allow for callbacks 
- monitor review
    - SetProcessDPIAware, effective DPI
    - fix scaling units and math
    - refine monitor support
    - fix RGFW_window_getMonitor
    - fix hiDPI support (monitor.pixelRatio)
- fix transparency support (GLX) (WGL)
- Windows XP Support, don't call unsupport functions, testing
- remove weird tabbing synax (eg. extra tabbing in a #ifdef for functions)
- gamepad (joystick) review/rewrite

    - change enums (RGFW_GP_A -> RGFW_gamepadA)
    - support for gamepad names, types, refined axis checking, change mapping
    - fix gamepad bugs and made gamepad support more stable overall
    - get gamepad count
    - RGFW_isPressedGamepad, RGFW_isHeldGamepad, RGFW_isReleasedGamepad, RGFW_wasPressedGamepad, RGFW_getGamepadAxis, RGFW_getGamepadName, RGFW_getGamepadCount, RGFW_getGamepadType
- keycode rewrite/review
    - rewrite keycodes to use physical keycodes (event.key) and add keyChar for scancodes

Release:    RGFW 1.05 (Jul 5, 2024)
----------------------------------------------
RGFW 1.0 is Finally out, with plenty of bug fixes and features being properly implemented on all OSes.
Plus a couple more features added for sake of completeness. Some reworking of functions and other cleaning of the RGFW codebase.

All of RGFW's basic features should be mostly finished now, the next release will focus on adding things not included in base RGFW 1.0.
In later commits, the CHANGELOG will be updated while the release is being worked on.
1.5 also has a lot of breaking changes, this is because these are essential changes for API consisteny and to exposes functionality in better ways.
