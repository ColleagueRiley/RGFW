RGFW:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP an stb-style single headerfile and is very portable
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP primarly written in C99 in mind
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBhas\fP a C89 compatible API on going changes to make the implementation more C89 friendly
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP comparable to GLFW or aspects of SDL but it's leading motive is to be a flexible and lightweight windowing library
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP a very small compared to other libraries
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP a general framework and can be used for games, apps or tools
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdoes\fP only depend on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa, etc \fBNO\fP dependencies
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdoes\fP help you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGPU, Metal, or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP customizable, you enable or disable features
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdoes\fP work with X11 (UNIX), Wayland (\fIexperimental\fP) (LINUX), Cocoa (MacOS), Emscripten (WASM) and WinAPI (tested on windows \fIXP\fP, 10, 11, reactOS and has limited 9x support)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBis\fP multi-paradigm, with a flexible event system, including multiple ways of handling events (callbacks, queue, state lookups)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBdoes\fP include a large number of examples for learning RGFW
.PP
.PP
RGFW:
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
does \fBnot\fP handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context)
.IP "\(bu" 2
is \fBnot\fP an OpenGL focused library, RGFW can be used with ANY graphics API
.IP "\(bu" 2
does \fBnot\fP do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality
.PP
.PP
There is a Makefile including for compiling th examples\&. NOTE: \fCWAYLAND=1\fP OR can be defined to compile for wayland\&. \fCWAYLAND_X11=1\fP can be used instead if you want examples to fallback to X11 if a Wayland display is not found\&. This adds \fC#define RGFW_WAYLAND\fP in the implementation (or defines \fCRGFW_WAYLAND\fP AND \fCRGFW_X11\fP)
.PP
Included in the framework are helper functions for multiple rendering APIs OpenGL (Native, EGL, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, \fCMetal\fP and WebGPU, you can also easily blit raw data directly onto the window with the \fCRGFW_surface\fP object using \fCRGFW_window_blitSurface\fP\&.
.PP
You must explicitly request these helper functions via, \fC#define RGFW_OPENGL\fP, \fC#define RGFW_VULKAN\fP, \fC#define RGFW_DIRECTX\fP, \fC#define RGFW_WEBGPU\fP\&.
