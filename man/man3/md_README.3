\fC\fP.SH "About"
.PP
RGFW is a stb-style cross-platform general purpose windowing framework for apps, games and tools\&. It is written to be flexable and grounded\&. While RGFW is comparable to GLFW or aspects of SDL, it's focus is being a flexible and lightweight windowing library,
.PP
The API is C89 compatible, with an implementation currently written in C99\&. There are plans to make the implementation C89 compatible as well\&.
.PP
RGFW works with XLib (UNIX), Wayland (\fIexperimental\fP) (LINUX), Cocoas(MacOS), WASM (emscripten) and WinAPI (tested on windows \fIXP\fP, 10 and 11, and reactOS)\\ Windows 95 & 98 have also been tested with RGFW, although results are iffy
.PP
There is a Makefile including for compiling th examples\&. NOTE: \fCWAYLAND=1\fP OR can be defined to compile for wayland\&. \fCWAYLAND_X11=1\fP can be used instead if you want examples to fallback to X11 if a Wayland display is not found\&. This adds \fC#define RGFW_WAYLAND\fP in the implementation (or defines \fCRGFW_WAYLAND\fP AND \fCRGFW_X11\fP)
.PP
Included in the framework are helper functions for multiple rendering APIs OpenGL (Native, EGL, GLES), Vulkan, DirectX, \fCMetal\fP and WebGPU, you can also easily blit raw data directly onto the window with the \fCRGFW_surface\fP object using \fCRGFW_window_blitSurface\fP\&.
.PP
However, you must explicitly request these helper functions via, \fC#define RGFW_OPENGL\fP, \fC#define RGFW_VULKAN\fP, \fC#define RGFW_DIRECTX\fP, \fC#define RGFW_WEBGPU\fP\&.
.PP
Note for OpenGL: RGFW can internally create an OpenGL context after a window is created if you use the flag \fCRGFW_windowOpenGL\fP on window creation\&.
.PP
RGFW is multi-paradigm,\\ By default RGFW uses a flexible event system, similar to that of SDL, however you can use callbacks if you prefer that method\&.
.PP
This library
.PP
1) is single header and portable (written in C99 in mind) 2) is very small compared to other libraries 3) only depends on system API libraries, Winapi, X11, Cocoa, etc 4) help you create a window with a graphics context (OpenGL, Vulkan or DirectX) and manage the window and its events only with a few function calls 5) is customizable, you enable or disable features
.PP
This library does not
.PP
1) Handle any rendering for you (other than creating your graphics context) 2) do anything above the bare minimum in terms of functionality
